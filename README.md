## Math Skills Instructions

## The purpose of this project is for you to calculate the following:

*   Average
*   Median
*   Variance
*   Standard Deviation

### Average Mean
*   the average mean of a range of numerical values is, the sum of the values in the range, divided by the the range (amount) of numbers in the list.
*   ex: 2, 5, 6, 9, 12, 2, 3, 2, 7, 9
    *   the range of numbers in the list is 10,
    *   the sum of the values in the list is 57
    *   the average mean is 5.7 from the sum 57 divided by 10

### Median
*   the median of a range of numerical values is the value that is in the middle of the range
*   sort the range of numbers in ascending order
*   find the middle position; if there isn't a single value in the middle; add together the two middle values and divide by 2
*   ex: 2, 5, 6, 9, 12, 2, 3, 2, 7, 9
