## Math Skills Instructions

## The purpose of this project is to be able to calculate the following:

*   Average
*   Median
*   Variance
*   Standard Deviation

### Average Mean
*   the average mean of a range of numerical values is, the sum of the values in the range, divided by the the range (amount) of numbers in the list.
*   ex: 2, 5, 6, 9, 12, 2, 3, 2, 7, 9
    *   the range of numbers in the list is 10,
    *   the sum of the values in the list is 57
    *   the average mean is 5.7 from the sum 57 divided by 10

### Median
*   the median of a range of numerical values is the value that is in the middle of the range
*   sort the range of numbers in ascending order
*   find the middle position; if there isn't a single value in the middle; add together the two middle values and divide by 2
*   ex: 2, 5, 6, 9, 12, 2, 3, 2, 7, 9
    *   re-arrange the number is order: 2, 2, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 9, 12
    *   there is not a single value in the middle of the range
    *   the two middle values are: 5, 6
    *   sum 5 + 6 and then divide by 2
    *   the median is 11 / 2 = 5.5

### Variance
*   the variance is the measure of how spread out numbers are.
*   it is the *average* of the **squared differences** from the Mean.
*   to calculate the variance follow these steps:
    *   work out the Mean (the simple average of the numbers)
    *   for each value in the list: subtract the Mean from it and square the result (the squared difference).
    *   calculate the the average of the squared differences.
*   ex: 2, 5, 6, 9, 12, 2, 3, 2, 7, 9
    *   re-arrange the number is order: 2, 2, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 9, 12
    *   the average mean is 5.7 from the sum 57 divided by 10
    *   [ ((2-5.7)^2)*3 + (3-5.7)^2 + (5-5.7)^2 + (6-5.7)^2 + (7-5.7)^2 + ((9-5.7)^2)*2 + (12-5.7)^2 ] divided by 10
    *   (41.07 + 7.29 + 0.49 + 0.09 + 1.69 + 21.78 + 39.69 ) / 10
    *   the variance value is 112.1 / 10 = 11.21

### Standard Deviation
*   the Standard Deviation is a measure of how spread out numbers are.
*   its symbol is σ (the greek letter sigma)
*   the formula is the square root of the Variance.
*   using the above list as an ex: 2, 5, 6, 9, 12, 2, 3, 2, 7, 9
    *   the value of **average mean** is 5.7
    *   the value of **variance** is 11.21
    *   the formula for SD (standard deviation) is σ = √ variance value
    *   the **standard deviation** value for the above list of numbers is: √11.21 == 3.348
*   this shows which values in the list are within *one SD* (3.348) of the *average mean* (5.7)
*   upper value of *one SD* is *average mean* (5.7) plus 3.348 = 9.048
*   lower value of *one SD* is *average mean* (5.7) subtract 3.348 = 2.352
